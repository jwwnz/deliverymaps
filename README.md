## Problem to solve:

For delivery drivers, orders are requested to drivers most closest to the restaurant when a food order is lodged.
However it is difficult for drivers driving around to know exactly the best spot to drive to to wait for the next order.
Generally drivers intuitively drive towards an area where they believe that the most restaurants are.
However, this method is unscientific and inefficient.

## Solution: Delivery maps

This simple map application attempts to solve this problem by:

1. Displaying all delivery restaurants in the Auckland city area on a visual map.
2. Display your current location on the map to see how far you are from these restaurants.

## Future improvements:

There are a number of further functionality that is being considered, including:

- Different icons to represent different types of restaurants: McDonalds, coffee/desert shops/cafes, to allow drivers to better weed out which location they would rather be.
- Different colors to be displayed depending on closing times, eg. where red the restaurant has closed; where green open.
- Extract Google maps restaurant data to display different indications where the restaurant most busy (due to correlation with when would be most likely to be more orders).
- Live "score" to indicate whether their location is optimal (this is purely speculative at this stage, as any score would be intrinsically relative and subjective).
